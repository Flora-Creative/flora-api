# flora-api

The API for the Flora Creative website.  Currently it's incredibly under-featured, only accepts GET requests
to / in order to retrieve all apps metadata, or GET requests to /cactus (etc.) to retrieve a specific app metadata.

Note:
`src/Network` and `src/Text` are taken from https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet at commit
af38595ec1bd804bdc365d103c9142f595e6295c and modified slightly. The original license has been
reproduced alongside the source.
